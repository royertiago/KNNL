!.gitignore
# This repository was built from an existing SVN repository.
# SVN accepts the inclusion of empty directories; Git doesn't.
# This .gitignore tells git to ignore every file in this directory,
# except for this file; it exists solely to keep this directory
# nonempty, so that git does not refuse to include it in commits.
